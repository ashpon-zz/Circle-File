MapBox:
q: how quickly can we learn API?
2. is it a visual package or a developer's package?
3. upload the csv to mapbox
4. use it for compatetor
5. functionality:
	1. Layer 1 - preload the BBB stores on the NJ map drop pins 
	2. we 'click' on a pin and create a new 'layer'
	3. that 'click' will display location name / store name etc 
	4. default it will highlight all the zip codes up to 15 Miles within a circle
	5. use the slider to play with the distance / input distance circle will change  
	6. when changing the distance clear earlier display - clear all & bring in Layer 1
	7. on the bottom or side show demographic distribution by zip code in a pie chart 
BONUS:
	1. ability to select two or more locations/ store / pins 
	2. have overlapping circles 
	3. Show competitors - display pins (diff color) and overlap WITHIN the distance selected
	4. use API to get store locations 


Plan:
1.Data Collection and finalization - 
	a. Store locations - complete 80% use from the static data set
	b. census data: - Marek 
		b2 - Gender distribution - complete
		b3 - median age Male / Female  - complete
		b4 - population and income coming from uszipcodes - 50%

	c. Database design - Jon MySql
		T1 - Location table - LocationMaster
			Store name
			Address
			Lat
			long
			Zip code - PK
			State
			City
		T2 - Census data - CensusData
			Zip code - PK
			Total Population - from uszip
			Male Population
			Female Population
			Male Median Age
			Female Median Age
			Income - from uszip
		T3 - USZip code data (preloaded) - SuppDemo
			Zip Code - PK 
			Total Population
			Income 

2. Flask Engine - AN
	a. Create a default route to display NJmap 
	b. click on a location will call location route 
		2b1. pass lat, long, radius 
	c. get data from tables and send to API call

3. Presentation - Andy /Marek
	3a. HTML 
		Display NJ Map 
		Make a call to the default API
		Displau all stores on the map (Pins)
		bottom pane display data table 
	3b. JAVAScript
		on click on a pin call route 2 
		will return all zips within d miles 
		take each zip and highlight the zip on boundaries
